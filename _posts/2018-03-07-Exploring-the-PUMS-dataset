title: Exploring the PUMS dataset

The PUMS Amerian Community Survey is a dataset from the US 2011 Census, comprised of 3 million individuals and 1.5 million households. This dataset has ~200+ dimensions about individuals and households. I'll use R to load and get an overview of the data.

Dataset availible at (todo: link dataset)

Loading in the data, RStudio shows two frames - dhus (households?) and dpus (persons?)

dhus has 2982 entries covering 210 variables
dpus has 6279 entries spanning 288 variables

Looks like a decent amount of missing values (NA)

Can pull straight into R from github using read.table()

custdata <- read.table('',header=T,sep='\t')

Let's analyze with ggplot2

library('ggplot2') did not work, maybe its not installed

StackOverflow mentions:

install.package('ggplot2', dep=TRUE)

Using install.package('ggplot2', dep="TRUE") did not work - R seems picky about noquotes vs single quotes vs double quotes...

ggplot2 takes a WHILE to install!
